Learning Python through Fantasy Football with Fantasy Football Pros

I am currently taking a course from this website:
https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com

I did not have 2021 information available for ADP.

I copied this data from PPR Average Draft Position (ADP) 2021 from this website:
https://fantasydata.com/nfl/ppr-adp?season=2021&leaguetype=2&type=ppr

I was able to clean this data to make it comparable to the course chapter 6 data.
- I was also able to use a formula that makes row 2 row 0 for accurate csv formatting.
- I used Google Sheets to paste this data, export, load into VSC, and am attempting to push.

My desired outcome is to have equally formatted data to what the course provides from 2019, but for 2021 data so that I can generate ADP values contemporarily.
